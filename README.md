## News app to filter based on your criteria


### TODO
- filter search results somehow (on language to start with)
- figure out what to do with the search (how do you combine multiple topics)

- make UI prettier
-- css style for headers (color, font)
-- miniature images for articles?
-- article titles too long (wrap around)

- combine US and FR headlines
-- page w. 2 columns?

-- Add keywords to filter (and chose what source it applies to)
